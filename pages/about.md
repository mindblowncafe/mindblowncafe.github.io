# About

With the ubiquity of coffee shops/cafe and coworking space today, it's sometimes difficult to tell the advantage of one shop from the others. For one thing we're sure of, we know that they all served that one hot steamy cup of coffee we need.
A Coffee shop was always been there for the daily necessity for local coffee addicts, a place to dream of as you try to escape the daily stresses of life and just a comfortable place to meet your friends or to read a book, all in one. On the other hand , a coworking space is somehow a new concept today. Coworking is the new way of working and sharing. Coworking spaces are designed to provide a productive and collaborative environment for their dynamic inhabitants, and created without corporate constraints on what is perceived to be an “office” environment offering flexible memberships to suit most needs.
