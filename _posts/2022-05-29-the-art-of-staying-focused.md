## The Art of Staying Focused
_[Course: The Art of Staying Focused.]_
**HOST**: No matter who you are or what job you do, staying focused at work can be hard. Even with great time management and organizing skills it's easy to get off track if you're not careful. In this course, you'll learn how to stay focused, beat fatigue, deal with distractions, decline work-related requests, adjust your focus to deal with change, and regain focus once you've lost it.

## Focus Challenges: Beat Procrastination & Temptation
_[Topic: Focus Challenges: Beat Procrastination & Temptation.]_
**HOST**: Everyone has trouble focusing sometimes. It's human nature. Life and work are full of distractions.

When it comes to getting focused, sometimes the hardest part is getting started – even if you're organized and know exactly what you need to do. But knowing yourself – and your weaknesses – can help you work around your problem areas and get in the right frame of mind.

**SETH**: I put stuff off and put it off…I just can't stop! Or maybe, I just can't start…

**HOST**: This is one of the common focus challenges – procrastination. At some point most people have said "I'll do it tomorrow." So how do you overcome it? One fun approach involves using rewards and motivators. When you complete a task, you reward yourself. So maybe after 30 minutes of focused work, you take a coffee break.

And while you're drinking your coffee, think about why you're procrastinating. Are there any obstacles in your way? If you're unfamiliar with a new procedure at work, for example, maybe you're avoiding using it instead of just learning how to do it. Perhaps you don't have the right software you need, and you procrastinate instead of contacting the helpdesk to get it installed.

Sometimes though, you just don't know where to begin. You may feel overwhelmed when faced with a substantial task. But every large task is made up of smaller tasks. So break it into manageable pieces. Focus on one thing at a time. Maybe even start with your least favorite step to get it out of the way.

> Sometimes you can avoid procrastination by scheduling appointments to work on high-priority tasks – even if it's just a few minutes at a time. Once you get started, you might find you want to continue beyond your allotted time. It might even help to make your deadlines public…it's a lot harder to procrastinate when people are checking up on you.

**SETH**: Sure, those are good ideas. But sometimes I put things off because other things are just more interesting. Not because I'm avoiding anything.

**HOST**: It's hard to resist temptation when you're faced with a list of boring tasks to do. Try setting formal but reasonable limits for yourself and stick to them. Say to yourself, "I'll spend the first 15 minutes of the day reading the news, then I'll focus on work until it's time for lunch." It's a good compromise.

Or you could use cues and self-talk to stay focused. Ask yourself "What am I trying to accomplish? Does this activity help me get there?" Think about what happened in the past when you gave in to temptation: did it help or hinder your goals when you went off-task for a few minutes?

You're in control of your procrastination. Taking small steps to fight it will ensure your time wasting days are over.

## Beating Fatigue and Managing Multitasking
_[Topic: Beating Fatigue and Managing Multitasking.]_
**HOST**: So you're struggling to get stuff done. Whether at work, or at home, it's a problem. If you've crossed procrastination and temptation off your list of suspects, maybe you're suffering from fatigue.

**LISA**: At work, sometimes I find it hard to focus because I feel burnt out.

**HOST**: That's a common problem. It sounds like you need to take better care of yourself.

Neglecting your physical or emotional well-being doesn't help anyone. Always try to get a good night's sleep. Easier said than done. But if early nights aren't possible, find energy elsewhere: fresh air, exercise, a healthy snack, or support from another person can all help.

> When you're working, take breaks between tasks to recharge your batteries. You're a person, not a machine. If you have a desk job and sitting all day makes you drowsy, stand up and stretch your legs. Your schedule needs to complement your energy levels. Try to plan your toughest tasks for when you feel most energetic. Or where you feel most energetic. Maybe you're at your best after your morning coffee? Maybe you could make all those calls in a nearby park or sitting out on your office balcony?

**SETH**: My problem is boredom. I need variety to keep my energy up. So I find myself switching between tasks throughout the day.

**HOST**: It takes 20% to 40% longer to complete tasks if you're switching between them. Use the 80/20 rule and do the most important things first. This means that often 80% of all outcomes can be attributed to 20% of the causes. So if responding to online requests for quotes lets you work with 80% of your clients but only takes 20% of your time, give those requests your full attention.

_[Tom is in the middle of answering e-mails on his mobile phone.]_
(TRYING TO CONTAIN HIS IRRITATION) **TOM**: I hate those admin tasks I've got to do all day long. Half my day is spent answering e-mails. I've got more important things to worry about right now! (SIGHS)

**HOST**: I think most people can relate to that, but there are some quick fixes you can try.

Batch processing is one way. To make it work, you set aside blocks of time to focus on specific tasks. So, for example, don't keep your e-mail open all day and respond to messages as they come in. Instead, dedicate some time to your inbox in the morning, then close it till later.

Another thing to try – include "white space" in your day. Your brain needs time to do nothing. Nothing means no thinking, reading, or talking. You could use this time to exercise, listen to music, or even just stare into the distance.

> To beat fatigue, you have to take care of yourself – physically, emotionally, and mentally. Re-examining the way you work can also have huge benefits. Ditch the multi-tasking and put your energy to better use. Because how can you do your best when you don't feel your best?

## Blocking Out Distractions
_[Topic: Blocking Out Distractions.]_
**HOST**: Distractions. Sadly, they happen all the time and usually there's little you can do to prevent them.

Even if you have great ability to concentrate, you probably still work in an environment that's full of interruptions.

[The host and Seth are talking at Seth's desk.] You'll never be able to eliminate distractions entirely but you can definitely learn to manage them better.

**SETH**: But how? I mean, I can't just shut the door when I work in an open-plan office…

**HOST**: Obviously, in an ideal world, you'd close the door, put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign, and turn off every distracting device. But this isn't possible for a lot of people.

So let's assume you don't have your own office. How do you make it work? Well the first thing to do is physically orient yourself away from the busy areas. If you can't see activity that would normally catch your attention, you can't be distracted. If that's not possible, maybe there is an empty meeting room or a library you could use instead.

[Seth and the host are talking at Seth's desk.] SETH: Sometimes I work in our conference room but people still come and find me to have a chat. They don't seem to get the message.

**HOST**: You might need to let people know you're focusing.

It's really OK to hang a "Do Not Disturb" sign. If you think that's too much, you need to find a creative way to tell others "Emergencies only!" If your workplace uses office scheduling software, you could block off "busy" time so others can see you're unavailable.

> Now that you've dealt with the human interruptions, next you have to tackle the technological ones. Turn off all alerts: e-mail, texts, and social media. Especially social media…you don't need to read your friend's updates while you're working. Workplace e-mail alerts can be turned off for short periods. And it's a good idea to unsubscribe from any group e-mails you don't need.
Neutralizing environmental noise is another good idea. Especially if you sit near an office hotspot, like the copier. Pump up the white noise or use earplugs or headphones. But don't let the music distract you from your work!

[Seth and the host are talking at Seth's desk.] SETH: My main problem is drop-in visitors though. Even short visits add up; before I know it, the day is gone and I haven't accomplished anything.

**HOST**: If you're serious about deterring drop-in visitors, you could try setting up appointments with people who need to chat.

People need to know that you can't just drop everything when they drop by unannounced. If you get lots of visitors with the same questions, try posting FAQs outside your cubicle so people can find the answers themselves. You can fit time in your schedule to handle e-mails, interruptions, and unexpected tasks – kind of like setting "office hours" – when you're available to others.

Your designated focus time is precious. So make sure you protect it by blocking those inevitable distractions. You can't control interruptions, but you can control how you deal with them.

## How To Say "No"
_[Topic: How To Say "No".]_
**HOST:** Let's face it – saying "no" can really be tough, especially if you're a people-pleaser.

Lots of people struggle with this. They think saying no makes them look incompetent or unfriendly. Or they don't want to hurt someone's feelings or be a bother to others.

> Saying no is important, but that doesn't mean you should never say yes. There's a balance. You need to work out when you can say no and when you can't. If you're not sure whether it's one of those times or not, ask yourself what would happen if you refused. Is it really a deal-breaker, or is it just your own internal pressure making you feel guilty?

LISA: I hate to say no, but when I say yes, I end up with way too much on my plate. My colleague just asked me to help him organize a charity fun run for the office. How can I say no to that?

HOST: Fortunately for Lisa, there's a way to say no without making it seem personal or rude. The most effective refusal has a few qualities. First it begins with a positive. So Lisa could open with, "That's such a great idea..." or "It's good that you're so proactive..."

Next you decline – firmly but tactfully. That could be something like this: "I really want to say yes, but I'm afraid I can't. I hope you understand."
You can choose to be specific – "I'm going away that week" – or vague – "I'm overcommitted right now." It's up to you to decide how much detail you want to give.

So you've firmly declined. Now what? You need to end on a positive. Sandwich the negative between the positives. For example, "I'm flattered that you asked…" or "I can ask around to see if anyone else might like to take my spot."

LISA: It seems so easy when you put it like that. But what if it's my manager? Or someone else that I just can't turn down? (SOUNDING CONCERNED) That's a lot harder!

HOST: When you can't refuse outright, try to say something other than "no." Maybe you could negotiate the deadline or terms of your agreement. So ask "Can I get it to you later?" "Does it have to be submitted in writing?" or "Could I get the first part done today, then deliver the rest next week?"

You could also try reversing the situation. Ask the asker. For example, "I'm currently working on compiling sales data. Does this new request take priority over that?" This is especially good for dealing with a manager.

> Learning to stand your ground isn't easy, but it's an essential interpersonal skill. To improve your focus and cut out distractions, say no to tasks and activities that pull you away from achieving your goals. The bottom line? Say yes to saying no.

## Deciding Whether to Adjust Your Focus When Circumstances Change
_[Topic: Adjusting Your Focus When Circumstances Change.]_
**HOST:** Unfortunately, life doesn't always follow routines and schedules. Sometimes a pressing issue that requires your immediate attention, lands on your desk without warning.

There's nothing wrong with putting aside your work to address a critical problem, but you need to know when and how to do it.

**SETH**: My team is responsible for auditing and analyzing sales data. Recently, I found out that we haven't been tracking customer comments on social media. There have been a few very negative comments. I work with data, not customers, but customer satisfaction is one of the company's key values.

**HOST**: When someone comes to you with an urgent issue – an emergency – you should use the triage process. First you need to clarify the issue's relationship with your goal and find out how urgent the issue actually is.

For you, Seth, customer satisfaction isn't your personal goal, but because it affects the overall organization, it affects you as well.

Next you need to make a decision based on the relationship of the issue to your goal. If it's directly related to your goal, take care of it. And give it your full attention.

So Seth, if someone tells you that the data you provided in your report is incomplete, and the report goes out tomorrow – would you stop and fix the issue right away?

*SETH*: Absolutely.

*HOST*: However, if the issue is directly related to a higher-order goal in the organization, but isn't your direct goal, you need to find the person who's best suited to take over. But you'll have to figure out the most time-efficient way to do that. It may be tempting to just deal with the problem yourself, but, if you brief the right person now, you can get the job off your plate permanently. You'll save more time than you might think. Just make sure you don't leave too many loose ends though, or you'll waste more time following things up later.

If the issue isn't related to your goals or one you support, reschedule or refuse it. It's not worth losing your focus when it's someone else's responsibility. For example, if someone asked Seth to conduct an orientation session for new hires in the Marketing Department, he could explain that his role is in data analytics.

> You don't have to lose your momentum just because the parameters of your task change unexpectedly. Switching gears to work on something else doesn't have to derail your efforts. A shifted project might even be an opportunity in disguise, if you can leverage that effort toward another project you're working on. Think of it as getting more bang for your buck. So try not to panic. Emergencies crop up. They're a part of life. Just regroup, readjust your focus, and come up with a game plan for determining – and executing – the right course of action.

## Correcting Your Course and Refocusing
_[Topic: Correcting Your Course and Refocusing.]_
**HOST**: No matter how hard you try, sometimes you just lose your focus. It happens to the best of us.

Distractions, day dreams, and unscheduled interruptions can easily cause you to just "drift away" from your work. Maybe you're hungry or tired. Sometimes when something breaks your focus, you may not even realize it's happening. Be aware of these tell-tale signs: drifting thoughts; losing track of time; feeling sleepy, emotionally scattered, or irritable.

If you've got the symptoms, how do you get back on track? One way is to think about your end goal and how it will feel to achieve it. Then consider the consequences of straying off the path. If the consequences are minor, don't worry about it. But if the negative impact on the end goal is significant, let that motivate you to push a little harder.

_[Tom and the host are talking at Tom's desk.]_
**TOM**: Got it. I need to think more about the finish line.

**HOST**: Exactly. And if you're going to get anywhere, you also need a positive attitude.

Everybody struggles with negative thinking sometimes. But don't forget that you control your thoughts. You have the power to reframe your feelings from negative to positive. You can do this by using self-talk to rewrite the monologue in your head.

[Tom and the host are talking.] (SOUNDING IRRITATED)
**TOM**: What if I'm thinking "I don't want to do this anymore?" And trust me, I think that at least a dozen times a day…
**HOST**: Well that's a negative thought. You need to rework it. How about, "I know I'll feel better about this if I set it aside and return to it later."

**TOM**: Ah, I see. That's definitely a more helpful perspective.

**HOST**: Just because you've gone a little off course, it doesn't mean you can't reach your goal. You might only be one small correction away from getting back to where you need to be.

Perhaps that small correction could be found through some meditation. Pause. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind and listen to the "noise" in your head drift away. Stay in the moment. Then slowly reconnect to your work.

_[The host and Tom are talking.] So Tom, think you're ready to try this?_

**TOM**: I'll try anything once, if it might help.

**HOST**: Losing focus is just a small bump in the road. You can regain momentum if you keep moving forward. Even if you're feeling overwhelmed and tired, try checking off a few of the easiest tasks on your list. They may not be terribly important in the grand scheme of things, but you're still getting things done.

If you do lose focus, don't give up…you can find it again. And now you know how.
